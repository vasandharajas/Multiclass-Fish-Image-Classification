# Multiclass-Fish-Image-Classification

In the modern era, image classification has become a crucial component in a wide range of applications, from autonomous driving to healthcare diagnostics. This project focuses on multiclass image classification, specifically categorizing fish images into different species using deep learning techniques. The ability to accurately classify fish species has applications in various domains, including marine biology, environmental monitoring, and commercial fishing.

The project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), one of the most effective deep learning models for image classification tasks. In addition, to improve the performance and efficiency of the model, transfer learning will be utilized. Transfer learning involves fine-tuning pre-trained models (such as VGG16, ResNet50, and EfficientNet) that have already been trained on large datasets. These models can be adapted to the fish classification task, offering a faster training process and improved accuracy compared to building a model from scratch.

The project involves several key phases:
Data Preprocessing and Augmentation: To ensure the model can generalize well, images will be preprocessed by rescaling pixel values and augmented through various transformations such as rotation, zoom, and flipping.

Model Training: The core of the project is training multiple deep learning models:

CNN from scratch to establish a baseline performance.
Several pre-trained models will be experimented with, fine-tuned on the fish dataset, and compared to assess the best approach.
Model Evaluation: After training, the models will be evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to determine which model performs best for this classification task.

Deployment via Streamlit: The project culminates in the deployment of the best performing model as a Streamlit web application. This application will allow users to upload fish images and receive real-time predictions, displaying the predicted species along with a confidence score.

Through this project, users will gain hands-on experience with deep learning concepts, model evaluation, and deployment techniques. Moreover, it showcases how state-of-the-art machine learning models can be applied to a specific, real-world problem, enabling the automatic identification of fish species based on their images.
